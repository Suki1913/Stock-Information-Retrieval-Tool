# Stock-Information-Retrieval-Tool

Investment in stocks requires regular study about market trends, the variations in the price of each stock, and proper knowledge about them. This involves time and constant dedication.
So to make it easier for one to retrieve information about stocks based on its gain or loss trend, either considering a week, a month, or a year and retrieve a report in form of graphs and data related to a particular stock, saved in different formats, making it easier to view, understand and share the information, we have programmed to automate the stock information gathering using python tools.
